# True Classic addon for BTW

This addon introduces a lot of changes that brings BTW closer to vanilla (parts of it from modern versions)

## The major gameplay changes:
- Block breaking speeds are mostly vMC
    - Let me know when something's off in terms of block breaking speed in this thread!
- Most things like sand (not the soul one), snow, crops, etc. no longer slow you down! Nether Groth is the exception, and will remain that way
- The vanilla insta-break is reimplemented here
- Armor weight, and the associated hunger cost is no longer a thing
- Buckets now act as they would in vMC (aside from lava buckets being unable to be placed)
- Hunger system and the regeneration acts kinda like vanilla (BTW hunger system is granular, regeneration costs hunger), while the food values deviate slightly from vMC
- Crops that are under the daily growth system will grow much faster, and farmland doesn't fall
